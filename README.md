This current iteration is a prototype to help demonstrate the IA for BioExcel Core Competency Profile. It shows only the KB aspect.

## The display
Columns from the Core Competency spreadsheet + BioSchemas mandatory fields (name, startDate, endDate, description, location, contact, hostInstitution, eventType) with some user tools (sort, keyword filter, facets, etc.)

## The KB data model as a subset of Core Competency
  - Each entry in the KB contains at least one Competency Mapping ID (competencyMapping)
  - Each entry in the KB contains a UUID
